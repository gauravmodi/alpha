# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# Company.create(name: 'Nexus Partners', description: 'This is the world of countless, infinite VCs.')
# Company.create(name: 'Matrix Partners', description: 'Your next door VC')
# catogories = Category.create([{ name: 'Accelerator' }])
